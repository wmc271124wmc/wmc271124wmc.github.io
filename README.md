# Multi-Agent LLM Systems: Interactive Literature Review

[![COMP4126 Research Methods](https://img.shields.io/badge/Course-COMP4126_Research_Methods-blue)](https://www.example.com/course_link) This repository contains an interactive visualization of a literature review on multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems. This project was created as part of the COMP4126 Research Methods coursework and is powered by [SurVis](https://github.com/fabian-beck/survis), a visual literature browser framework.

## Overview

This interactive literature browser presents a curated collection of 10 key papers exploring diverse approaches to multi-agent LLM systems. The papers are categorized based on their primary agent interaction paradigms, application domains, and memory integration approaches, facilitating a structured exploration of this rapidly emerging research field.

## Literature Categorization

The papers are organized into four main categories based on how LLM agents interact:

### 1. Self-Improvement Methods
Papers focusing on agents learning from their own experiences or reflections.
* *Reflexion: Language Agents with Verbal Reinforcement Learning*
* *Improving Language Model Negotiation with Self-Play and In-Context Learning from AI Feedback*
* *Unleashing Cognitive Synergy through Multi-Persona Self-Collaboration*

### 2. Debate-Based Methods
Papers using structured argumentation between multiple agents.
* *Improving Factuality and Reasoning through Multiagent Debate*
* *Encouraging Divergent Thinking through Multi-Agent Debate*
* *ChatEval: Towards Better LLM-Based Evaluators Through Multi-Agent Debate*

### 3. Role-Based Collaboration Frameworks
Papers establishing structured workflows with specialized agent roles.
* *CAMEL: Communicative Agents for Mind Exploration*
* *MetaGPT: Meta Programming for Multi-Agent Collaboration*
* *Multi-Agent Collaboration: Harnessing Intelligent LLM Agents*

### 4. Game-Theoretic Approaches
Papers applying multi-agent interaction to game scenarios.
* *Exploring LLMs for Communication Games: An Empirical Study on Werewolf*

### Cross-cutting Dimensions
The literature is also analyzed across:
* **Application Domains:** Code generation, reasoning, negotiation, evaluation.
* **Memory Integration Approaches:** External memory, in-context experience, no explicit memory.

## How to Use the Visualization

1.  **Filtering:** Use the tag selectors at the top of the visualization page to filter papers by categories, application domains, or memory integration approaches.
2.  **Searching:** Utilize the search box to find papers by author, title, or specific keywords.
3.  **Visualization Modes:** Explore different visualization modes (if available in your SurVis setup) to understand relationships and patterns among the papers.
4.  **Details on Demand:** Click on any paper in the visualization to expand and read its full abstract and other details.

## Technical Information

This visualization was created using [SurVis](https://github.com/fabian-beck/survis), a framework for Visual Literature Browsers developed by Beck et al. The literature data is stored in BibTeX format (`.bib`) and converted to JSON (`.json`) for the interactive visualization.

## Paper Selection Methodology

The selection process involved a systematic search focusing on influential multi-agent LLM research published primarily in 2023. The chosen works represent key developments and diverse approaches within the field.

## About the Coursework

This interactive visualization serves as a component of a comprehensive literature review on multi-agent LLM systems for the COMP4126 Research Methods course. The full literature review encompasses:

* An analysis of current challenges in the research field.
* A clearly defined scope for the survey.
* Detailed summaries of each selected paper, organized by the categories outlined above.
* An in-depth discussion of emerging research trends and future directions.

## Credits

* **Visualization Framework:** [SurVis](https://github.com/fabian-beck/survis) by Fabian Beck et al.
* All papers included in the visualization are properly cited with links to their original sources.
